Once an idea comes to mind, if all the information can be extracted from a video link on YouTube. 
Then dynamically present a YouTube channel to another website. 
I kept trying for many days. I finally made it today
Get Youtube Information . 
I have used in this project/script : html , css , js , jQuery, youtube json and Youtube api. 
Hope you like it . Stay with me if you like coding...
